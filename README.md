A game about being a train ... with a commitment to simplicity.

In all things, train should be simple.
But here are some other things train would like to be as well.
# Goals
    - Be fun - You can ride around on a track and shoot at cactuses. Maybe some of the cactuses are mean.
    - Be small - This isn't meant to be some monolithic game-to-end-all-games. The game itself should be minimal, but so should the technology used to make it. Use as few runtime deps as possible; is anything other than glam and miniquad necessary?
    - Be 3D - I want some practice in making 3D models and minimal 3D renderers. I'm not interested so much in making anything high quality or photorealistic, but I'd like to be better at churning out models that get the point across quickly, and rendering them on low end machines.
    - Work well in web - I want to just be able to just link people the game, and have them playing it less than half a second later.
